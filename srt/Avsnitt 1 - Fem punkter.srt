1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,999
My name is Michel Blomgren and my
passion is wilderness survival...

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,999
...the art of keeping yourself alive
under harsh circumstances.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,999
This is the first episode in a series about
survival and the outdoors in Sweden.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,999
This episode takes you through five points
that increases one's chances in the Wild.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,999
To better illustrate these points, I'll take
you through a typical survival situation...

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,999
...lost in the woods in Autumn.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,999
SURVIVAL
with Michel Blomgren

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,999
As you probably understand, this guy
is lost.

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,999
He was just out for a short hike but took
the wrong path somewhere along the trail.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,999
As he consider himself to know the area
quite well, he tries to walk out...

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,999
...but what he as of yet hasn't realized is
that he's been walking around in circles.

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,999
He's not prepared and lacks map, compass
cellphone, whistle or gear for sleeping out.

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,999
Is he going to wander about the woods
until nightfall?

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,999
Is someone from civilization going to
report him missing?

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,999
Are they going to look for him in the
right area?

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,999
The answers to these questions can make
a difference between life and death.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,999
He still hasn't given up on the idea that
he might get out before dark...

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,999
that's why he's trying to walk out. The
darker it gets the more stress he feels.

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,999
Panic is an emotional reaction, an alarm,
that mobilizes the organism to fight or flight.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,999
To feel panic is nothing wrong, it's
completely normal.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,999
The reason for panic is fear, fear is like fire:
It can warm you, but also burn you down.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,999
Just like fire should be respected,
so should also fear.

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,999
No one is fearless, everyone are fearful.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,999
There are only 2 kinds of people: Those who
can control fear and those who can not.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,999
Thinking you are either one or the other
is wrong!

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,999
We are both kinds depending on the situation
and how that situation affects our emotions.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,999
(humility for the task)

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,999
The first rule when lost is not to get more lost.

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,999
When panic creeps up on you, imagine a
STOP sign.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,999
Point 1: STOP stands for
Stop, Think, Orient, Plan

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,999
Stop, don't increase your physical activity
that will only generate more stress.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,999
Sit down, breath deeply
do not hyperventilate!

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,999
If panic takes control over you rather than
you over it, you're GAME OVER...

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,999
...even if you're the greatest survival
expert in the world!

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,999
If you've got a thermos with something hot,
drink it, but slowly.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,999
If you're exhausted and breathing heavily,
do not eat, it's just going to make it worse...

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,999
...just like walking and eating at the same
time is exhausting.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,999
Think through your situation and orient
yourself.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,999
What time is it? How many hours of daylight
do I have? What gear do I have? Where am I?

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,999
How did I end up here? Can I get home
before nightfall?

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,999
If I don't get out, what do I do then?

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,999
Is someone going to report me missing?
In that case, when?

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,999
Is my last known position anywhere near
where I reported I would be?

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,999
Make a time plan where it says: If I don't
get home by X o'clock, I'm going to...

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,999
make an inventory, find or build a shelter,
light a fire and collect a lot of firewood...

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,999
The most difficult decision you can make
is decide to spend the night in nature.

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,999
It's much easier to push on thinking
"I'll eventually get out."

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,999
Perhaps it's most important to realize
that you have to make that decision...

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,999
...then the mind can prepare for
both alternatives, stay or go.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,999
If you wander around for several hours
without finding something you recognize...

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,999
...then it's time to prepare for the inevitable,
spending the night in nature.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,999
The earlier you realize you won't get out,
the more time you have to prepare.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,999
Point 2: Do not give up! Survival is 80%
in your head, only 20% physical.

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,999
Back to our lost friend, he has stopped and
is starting to think.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,999
Fractions of thoughts are rushing through
his head - it is time to focus!

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,999
Let's take a look at his gear...

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,999
The most important gear is the one we're
wearing, clothes.

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,999
Man's natural climate is 27 degrees C,
right now it's -3 degrees Celsius.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,999
This means we must maintain a difference
of 30 degrees in order to stay warm.

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,999
Hypothermia is the main killer in the
Wilderness on European latitudes...

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,999
...both because of cold,
but also because of rain/water.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,999
Water can conduct heat away from the
body up to 27 times faster than air.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,999
For this reason it is extremely important to
be able to build a shelter and make fire.

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,999
In the next episode I'm going to
demonstrate gear in greater detail.

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,999
If protection against rain and cold is
priority one, then water is priority two.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,999
Dehydration is very common in outdoor
activities.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,999
Water is something we can not be without
for more than a few days.

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,999
It is very unlikely that you will die of
starvation in a typical survival situation.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,999
Humans can survive over 40 days
without food!

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,999
The gear that our lost friend has with
him is minimal...

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,999
...but if it's used correctly it will save his
life during the coldest point of the night.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,999
A poncho of the American type is not
only rain gear, it's also a shelter.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,999
It's big enough and has grommets in each
corner.

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,999
The poncho is actually the only shelter I
bring, even in normal outdoor activities.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,999
Works great, gear with more than one use.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,999
Extra dry clothing is very important.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,999
Longjohns are underestimated. In cities
you can see people with polar jackets...

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,999
...but on their legs they have tight jeans
or thin pants for tropical climate.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,999
Longjohns of wool or fleece under a pair of
wind-proof pants keep the blood warm...

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,999
...all the way to the feet.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,999
Water is priority 2 after we can keep warm. A
thermos with something hot is nice in the cold.

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,999
We need to consume about 3 liters of water
during a normal not very physical day,

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,999
according to most recommendations.

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,999
I conducted a 5 day exercise during the
summer of 2005 with very little food.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,999
I soon noticed that I was drinking too much,
so I cut down to 1 liter per day.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,999
That was enough for that specific situation.

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,999
I recommend to drink more, especially
in Winter, when dehydration...

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,999
...make hypothermia worse.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,999
If you feel headache, drink lots of water.

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,999
Headache is one of the first signs of dehydration
and then you're already 2-3 percent dehydrated.

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,999
The color of urine should be clear, not
dark yellow - then you're dehydrated.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,999
When drinking enough you can think clearly,
very important when lost in the woods.

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,999
Never ration water, we don't have a water
reserve like we do a fat reserve.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,999
To neglect dehydration almost makes you
get used to it.

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,999
It will end with passive behavior
and eventually collapse.

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,999
Many streams below the mountain region
in Sweden are contaminated with...

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,999
parasites, bacteria, etc.

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,999
It's important (as hygiene in general is) to
clean water before drinking it.

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,999
All pathogens have an incubation period
before symptoms of disease appear.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,999
The time can vary from hours to months.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,999
The most common pathogens, the protozoans
and the bacteria...

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,999
have an incubation time around 2 days or
more (Salmonella strikes within hours though).

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,999
In Sweden this, statistically, means you will
get rescued before disease appear.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,999
Despite this, water ought to be treated as
the disease that may strike back in the World

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,999
...may be very painful.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,999
Bad diarrhea, bleeding intestine,
vomiting, are some symptoms.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,999
Boiling is, despite many modern solutions,
the best way to make water safe to drink.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,999
In order to boil water you need something
to boil in, a metal mug isn't all that wrong...

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,999
...but a cooking pot, like a coffee pot,
is much better.

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,999
Food isn't bad, but we can survive many
days without something to eat.

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,999
The hunger can be challenging after
8 hours since our last meal...

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,999
It can rumble a lot in the stomach.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,999
Some time later it will decline and the
hunger becomes much more bearable.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,999
The will to eat can be strong even during
the initial period, but can later transform...

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,999
into nausea. 1 of 20 vomit after 2-3 days
without food.

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,999
When the energy, the carbohydrates, are low
we can no longer work as fast as before.

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,999
It's very important not to work harder
than the body can handle in order to...

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,999
...prevent becoming dizzy or even faint.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,999
Ration the body's energy reserve by
walking and working slowly.

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,999
Survive longer - be cool. Work
determined but slowly.

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,999
When you've established yourself in
nature there's no reason to run around.

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,999
Point 3: 3 of something is a distress call.
3 blows in a whistle, 3 light signals, SOS, etc.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,999
In order to protect ourselves against the
weather we need to know about hypothermia.

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,999
Convection: typically responsible for 50%
of our heat loss.

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,999
Convection means air around us and in
between layers of clothing blows away...

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,999
by cold air and movement. Warm air is lighter
than cool air and moves away from the body.

127
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,999
Radiation: typically responsible for 30%
of our heat loss.

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,999
Heat (energy) is transfered to the colder
environment, even through clothing.

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,999
Heat radiation can be felt from the Sun
and from fire.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,999
Respiration: typically responsible for 10%
of our heat loss.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,999
The cold air we breath is heated in the
airways before reaching the lungs.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,999
Evaporation: typically responsible for 5%
of our heat loss.

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,999
Heat is transfered away from the body
through the process of vaporization of liquid.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,999
Sweat and wet clothing is the main reason
for evaporation.

135
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,999
Conduction: typically responsible for 5%
of our heat loss.

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,999
Heat energy is transfered from a warmer
material by direct contact with a colder one.

137
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,999
Heat is always transfered from a warm
place to a colder place.

138
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,999
To know what not to get in contact with
is important.

139
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,999
Water can conduct heat away from your
body up to 27 times faster than air.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,999
Aluminium can conduct heat about
100 times faster than ice.

141
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,999
No good idea to use an aluminium blanket
as sleeping mat, especially not in winter.

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,999
Point 4: 4 chores...
Shelter, Fire, Water, Signal for help

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,999
To choose a good spot for camp is
essential.

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,999
It should be close to water but
preferably not right next to a lake.

145
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,999
Cold air sinks down over lakes at night.

146
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,999
Enough firewood nearby is essential. In
Sweden a spruce forest is a good place.

147
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,999
Spruce can be used in shelter building,
making of a "sleeping mat" and fire.

148
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,999
If you lack string, you'll find it under
ground. Spruce roots are excellent...

149
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,999
as long as the ground isn't frozen.

150
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,999
During winter it's important to carry string
with you - especially up north.

151
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,999
Necessity is the mother of all invention,
it doesn't take long to find a string to use.

152
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,999
In short... you use what you got.

153
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,999
The poncho protects against wind & rain.
It's time to protect against the cold ground.

154
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,999
Spruce bows can be used to make an
excellent traditional bush bed.

155
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,999
Make sure the curve of the bow points
upward to help raise you from the ground.

156
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,999
This will create an air layer between you
and the ground, just like a sleeping mat.

157
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,999
The amount of bows is very important,
it's good if the bed reach your knees.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,999
The "spruce bow mattress" will sink a lot
when sleeping.

159
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,999
Please observe: The Swedish "Right to
Public Access" does not include taking...

160
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,999
spruce roots or spruce bows. Ask
permission from the land owner.

161
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,999
When lost for real you should break all
laws necessary to survive - it's your right.

162
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,999
You should be free as long as you can
defend your actions.

163
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,999
An English expression says more than
1000 words...

164
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,999
Better be tried by twelve,
than carried by six.

165
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,999
A good proverb in survival situations is:
Proper preparation prevents poor performance

166
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,999
especially when it comes to fire.

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,999
I'm collecting stones to make a fireplace.

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,999
A stone fireplace protects against ground
fire. The fire heats up the ground...

169
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,999
and ignite roots that smolder for days
that can turn into a nasty forest fire.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,999
A stone fireplace also make the fire burn
more efficiently than on the (wet) ground.

171
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,999
This is the result. Most importantly,
stones in the bottom.

172
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,999
The fireplace is placed no more than an
arms length from the shelter in order to...

173
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,999
be able to feed the fire from the shelter,
but not too close to catch spit from the fire.

174
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,999
It's time to collect fire wood...

175
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,999
Not all wood will do. We'll need different sizes.
Twigs light branches that light bigger wood.

176
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,999
First focus is the tinder which will light
the first twigs.

177
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,999
Birch bark is an incredible material that will
burn even after being submerged in water.

178
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,999
By scraping the surface into a fine material
you can easily light it with a fire steel.

179
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,999
The dry twigs under most spruces is
excellent kindling when dry.

180
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,999
Dry spruce twigs are excellent first fuel
to the fire.

181
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,999
Birch twigs that have dried in the sun burn
well even after rain.

182
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,999
The bark protects the twigs from getting
wet.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,999
Birch is excellent fire wood and can be
used even if birch contains a lot of water.

184
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,999
Many people say you can't use birch
unless it's -10 degrees C, but it does work.

185
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,999
If you can't find spruce twigs or birch
bark, you can make feather sticks.

186
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,999
Split wood burns much better than wood
that has not been split.

187
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,999
The wood is usually wet on the outside,
but dry on the inside.

188
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,999
This can be done with any kind of wood
and can even be lit with a fire steel.

189
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,999
You need to make several feather sticks
and split wood small to get a good result.

190
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,999
Once the fire is burning it's time to boil
a hot drink.

191
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,999
When water boils heavily it's safe to drink.
Big bubbles, no troubles is a good rule.

192
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,999
A tea of pine, or in this case, spruce
needles is an excellent forest tea.

193
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,999
To me, this drink symbolizes the sub-
arctic forest.

194
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,999
Instead of collecting single needles, take
whole twigs, preferably the tips.

195
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,999
The needles are rich in vitamin C during
Autumn, Winter and Spring.

196
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,999
Two hands full of needles to 1/2 liter
water will cover 1/3, or 20 mg...

197
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,999
of the Swedish recommended daily
intake of vitamin C.

198
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,999
10mg is however enough to keep scurvy
away, if you're going to be lost for months.

199
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,999
The needles also contain a small amount
of sugar which has a refreshing effect...

200
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,999
especially when tired and hungry. It
should boil for 20 minutes before served.

201
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,999
If you have a thermos, like our lost friend,
it's a good idea to fill it with this tea...

202
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,999
excellent to drink when freezing in the
middle of the night.

203
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,999
All is well that ends well. It doesn't
always end well though.

204
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,999
Who lives and who doesn't sometimes
make no sense what so ever.

205
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,999
Experienced outdoorsmen have perished
after just one night lost in the wild,

206
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,999
despite decent weather, clothing, good
gear and being physically unharmed.

207
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,999
While children under 6 years of age, even
infants, have survived extreme ordeals.

208
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,999
The will to live can not be taught, trained,
or learned by reading a book.

209
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,999
Each one of us must find our reason(s)
to live.

210
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,999
Perhaps it's enough to realize that one
want to live to survive?

211
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,999
The only thing one really need is the
ability to adapt to the new conditions...

212
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,999
that a survival situation has to offer.

213
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,999
5, the last point, the gear I consider
valuable in every outdoor activity.

214
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,999
Gear will only help the one who wants
to survive. Give up and gear is useless.

215
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,999
1) A good knife is your best friend

216
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,999
2) 2 means to make fire, a primary
and a secondary

217
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,999
3) A whistle is heard much further than
the voice, and lasts much longer too

218
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,999
4) A compass to navigate straight through
the forest

219
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,999
5) A first aid kit

220
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,999
I'm going to finish up by repeating my
5 points.

221
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,999
But first I want to thank you for watching!

222
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,999
1) STOP - Stop Think Orient Plan

223
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,999
2) Do not give up!

224
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,999
Few have died fighting on, many by giving up!
-- Swedish Defense Survival Handbook

225
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,999
3) Three of something is an international
distress signal

226
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,999
4) Four chores in a survival situation

227
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,999
Shelter

228
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,999
Fire

229
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,999
Water

230
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,999
Signal for help

231
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,999
5) Five things one should always carry
in the woods...

232
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,999
Knife

233
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,999
Two ways to make fire

234
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,999
Whistle

235
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,999
Compass

236
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,999
First aid kit
