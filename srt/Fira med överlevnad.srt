1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Damn, I have to hold [the camera]
with one hand - this doesn't work well...

2
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,699
The big surprise...

3
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,699
All gear down with us.

4
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,798
- So, how does it feel?
You have not eaten in how many hours?

5
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,098
- 24 hours without food, except
some yoghurt this morning.

6
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,098
- Yes, except some yoghurt.
- I'm a little blurry...

7
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,598
- The brain isn't very fast... I'm tired.

8
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,899
- Very tired.

9
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,899
- The food fantasies are already evident.

10
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,399
- It's wet, everything is completely wet.

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,399
...it's depressing.

12
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,499
- How the hell can it smoke that much?!

13
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,299
- Damn smoke signal fire wood.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,999
- Well, what's for dinner today?

15
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,098
- I can always eat the Polypody I found.

16
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,098
- It's Polypody and the last energy bar.

17
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,098
...unless we can find something more.

18
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,098
- Myself have this to eat...
Emergency food rations.

19
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,098
...it's what I've got to eat...

20
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,098
...and some gruel.

21
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,098
Enough for... two, three cups or something.

22
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,399
So it's something like...
1000 kcal or similar.

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,399
What have you brought to eat?

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,399
- I brought 2 of these. I ate one
earlier today.

25
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,399
It's an energy bar.

26
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,399
It contains about 200 kcal.

27
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,399
Only one left, but I also have one
of these...

28
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,399
It's a kind of gel... fast energy.

29
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,399
Before the abseil tomorrow I'm going to
abseil this down my throat...

30
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,399
So my head is a bit more clear.

31
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,698
So far we've only found Polypody,
hope we can find something more to eat...

32
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,698
...if not, I'm going to be hungry.

33
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,698
- Boil pine needle tea later.
- Pine needles, yummy yummy yummy

34
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,698
- Mmmm...

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,999
Manufactured February 1987.

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,599
Vintage food!

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,599
- Is it wet?

38
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,599
- Naa, barely raining.

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,599
It's nice, lucky we're dressed right for
this kind of weather.

40
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,599
- Exactly.

41
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,599
- I wouldn't want to be dressed in cotton
right now.

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,599
- Yes, that would've been cold.

43
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,599
- It's us they're hunting, huh?

44
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,599
- How have the night been anyway?

45
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,999
- The night have been good the first
6-7 hours.

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,999
The rest of the time my feet were
freezing.

47
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,999
Made a fire and tried to sleep next to it
as much as possible.

48
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,999
Made a fire... sleep...

49
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,999
wake up... freezing my feet again...

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,999
Just repeat. That's how fun it is...

51
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,499
I have a bad headache because I haven't
been drinking enough.

52
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,499
We're going to rappel soon...
within an hour.

53
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,499
- Within an hour? We'll see how that go...

54
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,499
- I'm going to eat my last energy gel.

55
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,999
- !?!@!

56
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,999
- It doesn't taste good?

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,999
- It says "strawberry flavour"

58
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,999
- Na, the taste was no hit.

59
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,999
- What? That bad?
The taste isn't sweet or what?

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,999
- Na... maybe... it tastes like...

61
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,999
- Let me taste some...

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,999
- It's like a concentrated juice mix
without water.

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,999
- No, it wasn't very nice.

64
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,999
- That's what you get for eating the last
energy bar yesterday.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,999
- Rock n roll!

66
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,999
- We just got to find the right spot.

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,999
- Ready for this?
- Absolutely!

68
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,999
- Aha, you're filming?
- Yes.

69
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,499
- I'm trying to film too, but I really
need two hands to work the rope.

70
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,999
- Haha, well hello!

71
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,999
- Call of nature. I thought I'd wait till you
got down, but it took too long.

72
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,999
- Yeah, I'm too slow.

73
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,999
- Cool!

74
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,999
- Damn rubber band.

75
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,999
- So... now the... survival weekend is over...
almost anyway.

76
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,999
- Almost, not until I get something to eat.
- No, of course.

77
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,999
- Kebab pizza was it?

78
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,999
- Mmm... think so!

79
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,499
- As greasy as I can get it.
- Exactly.

80
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,499
- How long is it since your last real
meal?

81
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,499
- I haven't eaten real food for...

82
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,499
soon...

83
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,999
24 hours... hell no... it's 48 hours...
since I had a real meal.

84
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,999
Last time I ate... what was it...

85
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,999
Yesterday... at 09:00 was the
last time I ate something.

86
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,999
After that I have only eaten roots...
and my damn energy bars...

87
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,999
...which I am very tired off right now.

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,999
To eat real food again...

89
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,499
I feel quite good... I only have
headache because of dehydration.

90
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,499
...otherwise I feel OK.

91
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,999
- Mm
- Mm

92
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,959
- The film shouldn't become a
feature (long) film.

93
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,240
- I was fishing here this summer.
- OK.

94
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,999
- How does it taste with real food?
- Very nice actually.

95
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,999
- Can't *!?@! speak properly...

96
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,999
- Damn it's good...
