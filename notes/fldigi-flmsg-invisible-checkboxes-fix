# Background: Checkboxes are invisible in Ubuntu Mate since fldigi uses gtk+ by

# Some FLTK applications support the -scheme command line option

flmsg -scheme base
flmsg -scheme plastic

# fldigi has to be configured from within via menu path:
# Configure / UI / General. Choose UI scheme (base is probably the best
# option).
